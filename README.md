# Swim-Meet-tool
A tool to help score and set lineups for NJSIAA dual meets and similar format swim meets

Short-term plans: 
- create a calculator program that can correctly score a meet given a text file with times
- Current needs: converting 00:00.00 time format to a floating point/double format, parsing file input, the actual scoring algorithm

Medium-term plans: 
- incorporate swimmer names, calculate scores by swimmer, high scorer, etc.

Long-term plans: 
- create a feature that allows a coach to enter his swimmers and their times, as well as an opposing lineup, and find the best lineup to beat the opposing lineup
- host this on some cloud service so it can be accessed on the internet on a website; easy user interactions
- sell for a billion dollars and retire (lol)
